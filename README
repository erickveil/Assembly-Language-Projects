Parity

input an unsigned word, it counts the number of set bits and determines if that number is even or odd.

ml bitcount.asm io.lib
or run mkbit.bat

=====================================================
Pseudo Random Number Generator

a project to illustrate proc calls in asm.
to assemble:
ml randmain.asm rand2.asm io.lib

or run makerand.bat

Goal: call random proc, seeded by the system clock, range 0-9999, 100 times and display the numbers. Then switch the seed to 5555h, call the proc 100 more times. Collect and print total data regarding: how many even or odd numbers returned, was number < or > 500.
